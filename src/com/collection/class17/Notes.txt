types of variables in Java:
There are 3 types of variables in Java
    1) local variables
    2) instance
    3) static
local variables:
Are those variables which are declared inside a block of
code(method,loop, constructor,switch etc.)
When to use:
Always why because they occupy the memory for the shortest period of time in all
the variables as soon as block of code is executed memory is free and can be
used by other programs. we can not use static keyword with local variables.

2) Instance variables:
    Those variables which are outside of block of code but inside a class without static
    keywords are called instance variables
When to use:
    when we know that from object to object we will be having different values and we might
    also need to share the variables between different instance methods of that class
3) static variables:
    Those instance variables that have static keyword with them are called static variables.
    one single copy of variables is shared across all the objects.
    When  to use
    when  we need to share something with all the objects
    they mostly used as constants
We can also have instance and static methods but we can not use instance variables or methods
directly inside a static method if we want to use them we must create an object of that class
but for instance methods we can freely use both types of methods and variables.
