Instance variables:
    variables which are declared outside a method, loop,constructor or
    a block of code but inside a class without static keyword are called instance variables.
    We call them instance variables because for each object of that class a new copy of the variables
    is created in memory.
When to Use:
    when a value is expected to change from object to object we should declare an instance variable for
    those values.
Static variables:
    instance variables with a static keyword are called static variables. They are called class level variables
    because their value stays same across all the objects and only one memory location is occupied from the main
    memory
When to Use:
    when we have to share something across all the objects or if something is same for all the objects we should
    store that info in a static variable.
    mostly they are used as constants
    As a good practice we should access them using the class names
Local variables:
    variables which are declared inside a method or loop or switch case or any block of code are
    called local variables.
    we can not use static keyword with local variables
    local variables occupy the memory in computer for shortest period of time

static methods:
we can have static methods as well but static methods can not access instance variables
while not static methods can access static as well as not static or instance variables
this should be updated
